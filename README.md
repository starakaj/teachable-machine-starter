ml5 Face Tracker Scaffold
===========================

This app is a very small scaffold to get you started using ml5's face tracker. It will work with webpack, but will require an internet connection to run since it loads ml5 from a CDN.

The react + webpack portion has been copied by @starakaj for your enjoyment, and then React has been removed You can find the original at https://glitch.com/~starter-react.

The ml5 bit is copied from the example at https://ml5js.github.io/ml5-examples/p5js/FaceApi/FaceApi_Video_Landmarks_LocalModels/

This project relates to video 2 of 5 in the [React Starter Kit](https://glitch.com/react-starter-kit) video series.
